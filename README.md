Great course about Responsive Design with a lot of new information for me. Learned about what things make a website responsive, what is breakpoints, how control screen width and switch between layouts. Also I got better understand how flexbox works. Responsive Patterns are totally new to me. I saw it on sites but never knows how it's done.
